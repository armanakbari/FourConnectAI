"FourConnect," also known as "Connect Four," is a classic two-player connection game that involves strategy and critical thinking. The objective of the game is to be the first player to connect four of your own colored discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a grid.

Here's a brief introduction to the game:

## Game Setup:

  The game is typically played on a vertical grid with six rows and seven columns, resulting in a 6x7 playing area.
  Each player selects a color, usually either red or yellow.
  Players take turns placing one of their colored discs into any of the columns. The disc will occupy the lowest available position within the chosen column.

## Gameplay:

  Players alternate turns, placing one disc at a time.
  The discs are placed in such a way that they fall to the lowest available position within the selected column.
  The objective is to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of your own colored discs before your opponent does.

## Winning:

  The game is won when a player successfully connects four of their own colored discs in a row.
  The connection can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
  If the grid fills up without either player achieving four in a row, the game is a draw.
